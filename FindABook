3. Find a book
Imagine you are looking for a book in a library with a Dewey Decimal index. How would you go about it? Can you express this process as a search algorithm? Implement your algorithm to find a book whose Dewey and book title is provided.

I don't understand this problem and I don't see how this is useful. I vaguely understand the Dewey Decimal System.
